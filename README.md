# Natural Selection Experiment

Taking inspiration from David's excellent video [I programmed some creatures. They Evolved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk), I decided to reproduce a simplified versino of the simulation (without pheromones or population density concerns) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Piston](https://www.piston.rs/) to help visualise the simualtion.
